# Bash tools

## [`merge.sh`](./merge.sh)

There are several books that come in large files (exceeding GitHub's single file limit of 100 MB). Hence the books are split into chunks, and this script is written to merge those files.

Run

```bash
bash ./merge.sh
```

to merge all the books. The console output will display the books that are merged.
